ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @priniraula

Here are some facts about me: 

* I am a student in University of Waterloo in Honours Math program. 
* I am looking to major in Combinatorics and Optimazation because I am very interested in graph theory.
* I enjoy programming in many languages such as C++ and Lua. 
* Currently I am learning Typescript/Javascript and React through some Udemy courses. 
* I love playing guitar and during free time, I enjoy creating random models and practicing my modelling skills in blender. 

This account was created to showcase some of the projects written in my resume. 
Currently, I am trying to import projects from my main github account @zslya which contains most of my projects. 

I have another github account @wxhly which I do not use it all that much anymore since that email was compromised. 
Over the course of this week, I will be updating this account to import the updated version of many projects. 

If you are interested in viewing the rough/broken version of the project, consider checking out @zslya. I will be making most of my repositories public soon. 

Thanks for checking me out!
